</p><p>A number of these files, including some of the more clever algorithms,
were adapted from work done by Jose Ambros-Ingerson for a different
project.  Morphology files for 4 vestibular bouton afferents,
reconstructed from turtle, are included.
</p><p>These scripts together with the simple GUI provided can be used
directly to reproduce voltage traces in Figs 3-5 and data points in
Figs 6-8 with only changing tstop.  Tstop = 1000 ms here which is
sufficient to illustrate runs that complete in a short amount of time.
For the paper it was necessary to use tstop values of a few MINUTES in
many cases in order to accumulate a large enough number of spikes to
allow cv to be computed accurately.  These simulations were run in
batch mode and took days in some cases.

Usage:<br/>
------<br/>
Compile the mod files in the method appropriate for your platform
(nrnivmodl on linux/unix, mknrndll on mswin/mac os x) and then run one
of the following which generate the graphs shown by default. If you
need more help consult the web page: <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide</a>
<p/>
Once you start the program select Tools->RunControl and then click on
Init & Run.<br/>
To get cv results click on Parameters -> Run to get cv data<br/>
To get EPSPs for each synapse or Hair Cell activation click on Parameters -> Plot syn EPSPs (or Plot HC EPSPs)<br/>
